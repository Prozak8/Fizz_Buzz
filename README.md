### Fizz Buzz Challenge 

* Created my first .rspec extension to test function.
* Created first equation to be used so code looks cleaner.
    * Instead of 'if number % 3 == 0 'fizz'" I used def has_zero_remainder?(number, divider).

* To use this program go to terminal   then   load './lib/fizz_buzz.rb'   then   output = []   then   100.times {|n| output << fizz_buzz(n+1)>>}   then   output.
